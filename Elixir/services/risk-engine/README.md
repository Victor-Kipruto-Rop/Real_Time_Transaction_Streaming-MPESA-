# Risk Engine

**Purpose:** Low-latency risk signal evaluation and explainable risk assessments; never autonomously reverse payments or move funds.

## Current scaffold

Standalone Phoenix application with an OTP supervision tree, JSON health/readiness routes, runtime configuration and telemetry hooks.

## Required before production

- Implement business handlers, explicit API/event contracts and domain-specific tests.
- Add OIDC/JWT verification or authenticated internal service identity; health routes must not expose sensitive data.
- Define tenant context and authorization for every tenant-facing operation.
- Add persistence and migrations only where required, with a documented data owner and least-privilege database role.
- For asynchronous workflows, implement durable inbox/outbox, idempotency, bounded retries, durable DLQ and audited replay.
- Add broker/database adapters, dependency-aware readiness, metrics exporter, tracing, dashboards, alerts, SLOs and runbooks.
- Apply request-size/rate limits, safe logging, secret rotation, dependency/SBOM scanning and graceful shutdown.
- Test restart recovery, duplicate events, poison messages, timeouts and downstream outages.

The current endpoints are scaffold health checks, not proof of domain implementation or production readiness.
